# EE441---Programming-Assignment-2

Part 1 – Maze Solver
A maze is a path or collection of paths, typically from a start point to a goal. In this part, you are going to
implement a text-based maze class and a solver for it.

In this implementation, the terms “left”, “right”, “forward” and “back” are used for the directions with
respect to the agent’s current orientation; while “west”, “north”, “east” and “south” are used for absolute
directions. In the text-based representation,
• walls are denoted with ‘#’,
• empty cells are denoted with ‘.’,
• target is denoted with ‘T’,
• current location is denoted with ‘W’, ‘N’, ‘E’ or ‘S’, depending upon the orientation.

Part 2 – Linked List Implementation

Consider a doubly linked list):
Each node contains one data field and two address fields. In this question, we will
investigate the memory-efficient version of Doubly Linked Lists, which will be created using only one
address field for each node. This is called XOR Linked List, as the list uses a bitwise XOR operation to
save space for one address.
